This app utilizes a few API's to gather data, primarily movie information currently in theaters and Tweets corresponding to each movie.  The app then scans all tweets per movie to develop a sentiment.  The sentiment is then quantified and spit out as a FlickRec score.  The FlickRec score is used as a rating for a movie in an instance.  For example, a new movie will have a higher score than movies that are older.  The lower score doesn't necessarily mean the movie is bad because it also calculates the strength of the trend as well.  Given the strength and sentiment; we can then get a good idea about what others are watching and whether or not it's worth watching.
